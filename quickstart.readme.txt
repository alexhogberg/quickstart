Not my project but an alteration from http://drupal.org/project/quickstart

Before using standalone quickstart drush

1) Add mysql to your path:
	- For bash:
		echo 'export PATH=/path/to/mysql/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
	- For zsh:
		echo 'export PATH=/path/to/mysql/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
	
Note: If you are running MAMP your mysql/bin will be located at /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql

2) Modify apache (if using mac):
	1) Create a folder called sites-available in /etc/apache2/
	2) Modify httpd.conf and add this line:
		Include /etc/apache2/sites-available/
		
Note: same goes for MAMP here, your apache config will reside in a different place
